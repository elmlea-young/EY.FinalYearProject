READ ME for Emily Young final Year Project

This application was developed in Eclipse , all of the source code is included in this folder.

To begin the application run the file MainPageGUI.java.
This will load the initial landing page and the four animation choices are displayed there.

There is a class file for each window of the interface, named ___Run.java for the animation pages, or ___SetUp.java for the set-up pages. These are made using the windowBuilder and produced a java swing file.
Each of the windows where the Animation takes place has a corresponding java class to handle the back-end algorithms. These are titled ___Main.java and match the names of the run classes
